            <ul>
                <li>The anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan, "Nevada Semipalatinsk", was formed in 1989 and was one of the <strong>first major anti-nuclear movements</strong> in the former Soviet Union.</li>
                <li>It was led by famous <strong>kazakh writer Olzhas Suleimenov</strong> and attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually <strong>led to the closure of the nuclear test site</strong> in Kazakhstan in 1991.</li>
                <li>The movement was named "Nevada Semipalatinsk" in order <strong>to show solidarity</strong> with similar movements in the United States aiming to <strong>close the Nevada Test Site</strong>.</li>
                <li>The Soviet Union conducted <strong>456 nuclear weapons tests</strong> at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, between 1949 and 1989.</li>
                <li>The Semipalatinsk Test Site took the <strong>territory of the 18,000 km<sup>2</sup></strong>, and comprised an area the size of Wales.</li>
                <li><strong>More than one million people</strong> around Semipalatinsk were exposed to radiation, which caused birth defects and cancer.</li>
                <li>Nevada-Semipalatinsk played a positive role in promoting public understanding of <strong>"the necessity to fight against nuclear threats"</strong>. The movement gained global support and, became <strong>"a real historical factor in finding solutions to global ecological problems".</strong></li>
